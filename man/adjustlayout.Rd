\usage{
adjustlayout(graph, layout, width, height = 2, scale = 100, iter = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An igraph graph object.}

\item{layout}{A matrix with two columns representing the initial layout coordinates.}

\item{width}{A numeric vector of node widths.}

\item{height}{The height constraint for nodes.
Default is \code{2}.}

\item{scale}{The scaling factor for the layout.
Default is \code{100}.}

\item{iter}{The number of iterations for the adjustment algorithm.
Default is \code{100}.}
}
\value{
A matrix with adjusted layout coordinates.
}
